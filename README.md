# PartitionedFortress
A fortress of several guilds

## Idea
The idea for this fortress is to split it into several guilds that are mostly self sustaining and focused on a
particular task.

This idea comes from reddit user https://www.reddit.com/user/clinodev from the following thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/3ezqri/lets_talk_about_fortress_design/ctk27ic

## Branch Structure
The reason this is a repository is to allow fortress development like code development.  The branching model used will be as follows: 

* master will contain milestones
* develop will contain progressive modifications toward a goal/milestone
* feature/descriptionOfChange will contain unfinished minigoals

Because merging wont really work with these files, hotfixes and release branches will not be used.  Any abandoned branches will be just that, no partial merging.  The point is to keep everything separate until finished while allowing several reversion points.

## Milestones
I will write up what is planned each step of the way, like a real project.  The top milestone will contain the current development, while previous milestones will be what has been finished.

### 0.0.1
For this milestone, I'm just picking the world, not selecting a site.  This is to provide a reversion point here.
